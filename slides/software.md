## Code Review

* Why?
  * Learn
  * Share
  * Make code better

-

## Code Review Exercise

* What?
  * Is it clear what the code is doing?
  * Would it be easy to reuse parts of the program? Could this fail?
  * Is it easy to test?
  * Are there any bugs?
  * Are function/variable names descriptive?
* How?
  * Be positive and constructive
  * Point out things you like
  * Clarify reasoning where code doesn't match your expectations
  * Discuss your opinions
  * Is it worth changing? Sometimes it's OK to comment but take no action
